# Innovation-Day: Internet of Things - Node-RED Lab. 1. Check if your Intel Edison&reg; has Node-RED installed

This lab is using the Grove Starter Kit for Intel Edison&reg;, so you may have to prepare your device first, just follow this [Intel Edison installation tutorial](installedison.md) and then install the Node-RED environment.

## Node-RED installation

For using Node-Red with an Intel Edison&reg; board you will have to login inside the board using an SSH client like [Putty](http://www.putty.org/) or similar. Your lab trainer may have already prepared your Intel Edison device with a Node-RED server. You just need to go to your Edison IP Address and open a browser in the 1880 port like this:

1. Type the ```ifconfig``` command inside your Intel Edison and get your *wlan* IP address. If you don't have an IPv4 address, try to connect to the local WiFi again with the ```configure_edison --wifi``` command.
1. Open a browser to your board address *http://[YourBoardIPAddress]:1880*

If nothing opens, and you are sure your board is connected to the WiFi, follow these steps to install NodeRed:

1. Copy the bash file you will find in the [Scripts folder](./scripts/installnodered.sh) into the drive that appeared in your computer when connecting the Intel Edison
1. Detach your Edison from your computer, so the drive is mounted in the linux FS inside the /media folder
1. Run the script with the command:
    ```bash
    sh installnodered.sh
    ```

This script downloads and installs Node-RED as a daemon inside your Intel Edison&reg;, so it will be always running for you when to board is powered. The script will also install some useful libraries for controlling the Grove Kit sensors and connecting your board to Azure IoT Hub.

> If you need to restart or reload the service you can use the ```pm2 start|stop``` commands [(+info)](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/running).
